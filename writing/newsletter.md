I found a new routine that has made me SOOO much better at building with AI. The best parts are it’s FREE, only takes 10 minutes a day, and is extremely beginner friendly.

This whole new routine is based around one concept: shipping quickly and regularly. The more you ship, the better you get at shipping, even if you’re just shipping micro apps.

So here’s how I’m practicing this: Google AI Studio. It’s a completely free vibe coding tool online. But here’s the secret: it has a “I’m feeling lucky mode” where it gives you a random app idea to build out. You hit the button, a starter prompt for a micro app gets automatically placed in the prompting field.

Then you just hit ‘build’ and the AI builds the app out for you. From there, you can prompt the AI to add new features, change what you see, or even put the app live.

The whole process from going to the site to getting a live app takes under 10 minutes and is completely free. I’ve been doing this every day for a few weeks now and have over 20 micro apps built out and have generated HUNDREDS of ideas for other apps I can build.

Building and ideating are muscles. To build those muscles, you have to work them out regularly. Doing this 10 minute routine every day consistently is like going to the AI gym to build your AI/entrepreneur muscles.

I promise you if you do this every day for a month, you’ll have at least 1 app you can put live then start selling online. If you’re not making any money right now off AI, you literally have no excuse to NOT do this.

It’s completely free. You can use Google AI Studio a ton without paying a cent. Once you have a good idea you can even download it, open it with Google Antigravity, and add more advanced functionality.

I’m not being paid by Google, I just think this is an amazing opportunity to use their tools for free right now.

Try this out then reply back with the first app you build out! Would love to hear about it!
